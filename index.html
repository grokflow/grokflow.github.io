<p>I started programming at the age of 14 using C and was mind blown when I first knew about binary search. After earning my Computer Science Bachelorâ€™s degree from the American University in Cairo, I worked in a three-person R&amp;D team at a Computer Security company in Egypt. We developed IPSec and SSL-based VPNs with custom AES-like cipher and Elliptic curve cryptography.</p>

<p>When we were entertaining the idea of integrating the cipher in the OS kernel, I was reluctant because I thought only bad things will happen. Bad things did happen but the challenge was well worth it. My hands became very dirty that I am no longer afraid of approaching large undocumented codebases and spending long hours debugging. We worked on unpopular low-level things that at some point Google Search stopped being helpful. Hence my greatest lesson: read the source, Luke :) (and the manual)</p>

<p>I loved building things at high school: websites, Flash presentations, magazines, and documentaries. There is something magical when you go from an idea, a barely formed thought, to something you can see and interact with. But I stopped. Later I realized that I was just afraid of failure so I started building things again. I started by developing a marketing <a href="http://www.zon-solutions.com">website</a> for a friend's startup using <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>Bootstrap</strong>. </p>

</h2>

<p>Gang Up is a job board for startup opportunities in the Middle East. I built the frontend using <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>jQuery</strong> and the backend using Python <strong>(flask)</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong> with <strong>SQLAlchemy</strong> as the ORM.</p>

</h2>

<p>milzi is an image polling iOS app where users upload pictures along with any yes/no question and users vote yes or no. This was my first iOS app where I used AutoLayout and built the backend myself using <strong>Python</strong> (flask) and <strong>MySQL</strong>. </p>

<a id="endahly" class="anchor" href="#endahly" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a href="http://www.endahly.com">Endahly</a>
</h2>

<p>My first encounter with <strong>iOS</strong> and <strong>Objective-C</strong> was a messaging app I built called <a href="http://www.endahly.com">Endahly</a>. It enabled Egyptian car drivers to communicate using their license plate numbers as identifiers. This helped them solve car-related problems like double parking which are rampant in Egypt. I used <strong>Parse</strong> for data storage and push notifications.</p>
