{"name":"Ahmed Nawar","tagline":"Software Engineer. Mountain View.","body":"# Me\r\n\r\nI started programming at the age of 14 using C and was mind blown when I first knew about binary search. After earning my Computer Science Bachelorâ€™s degree from the American University in Cairo, I worked in a three-person R&D team at a Computer Security company in Egypt. We developed IPSec and SSL-based VPNs with custom AES-like cipher and Elliptic curve cryptography.\r\n\r\nWhen we were entertaining the idea of integrating the cipher in the OS kernel, I was reluctant because I thought only bad things will happen. Bad things did happen but the challenge was well worth it. My hands became very dirty that I am no longer afraid of approaching large undocumented codebases and spending long hours debugging. We worked on unpopular low-level things that at some point Google Search stopped being helpful. Hence my greatest lesson: read the source, Luke :) (and the manual)\r\n \r\n# On the side\r\n \r\nI loved building things at high school: websites, Flash presentations, magazines, and documentaries. There is something magical when you go from an idea, a barely formed thought, to something you can see and interact with. But I stopped. Later I realized that I was just afraid of failure so I started building things again. I started by developing a marketing [website](http://www.zon-solutions.com) for a friend's startup using **PHP**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap**. \r\n\r\nMy first encounter with **iOS** and **Objective-C** was a messaging app I built called [Endahly](http://www.endahly.com). It enabled Egyptian car drivers to communicate using their license plate numbers as identifiers. This helped them solve car-related problems like double parking which are rampant in Egypt. I used **Parse** for data storage and push notifications.\r\n\r\n##[Gang Up](http://gang-up.com)\r\nGang Up is a job board for startup opportunities in the Middle East. I built the frontend using **HTML**, **CSS** and **jQuery** and the backend using Python **(flask)** and **MySQL** with **SQLAlchemy** as the ORM.\r\n \r\n##[milzi]( https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/milzi/id1055486511?ls=1&mt=8) \r\nmilzi is an image polling iOS app where users upload pictures along with any yes/no question and users vote yes or no. This was my first iOS app where I used AutoLayout and built the backend myself using **Python** (flask) and **MySQL**. \r\n\r\n","google":"UA-71063920-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
