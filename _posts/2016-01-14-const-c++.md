title: Notes on const in C++
updated: 15 Jan 2016

The idea of `const`-ness does not imply that the variable is stored as read-only in the computer's memory. Rather, `const`-ness is a compile-time construct that indicates what a programmer _should_ do, not necessarily what they _can_ do. (paraphrased from Wikipedia)

#Syntax

###Simple Non-pointer Data Types
{% highlight c++ %}
const int x;
{% endhighlight %}
is the same as

{% highlight c++ %}
int const x;
{% endhighlight %}

Wikipedia cites historical reasons but doesn’t specify them. For me, I read the declaration from right to left. This way, both declarations are equivalent.
{% highlight c++ %}
//read as "x is an integer which is constant" 
const int x = 1; 
//read as "x is a constant integer"
int const x = 1; 

{% endhighlight %}

###Pointers
To make things easier, always surround what’s before the asterisks in parentheses. The declaration is read from right to left. Replace the asterisk with the word **pointer** and the type is whatever *before* the asterisk. 

{% highlight c++ %}
//cool_variable is a pointer to an int.
(int)* cool_variable;
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c++ %}
//awesome_variable is a pointer to a constant int.
(int const)* awesome_variable;
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c++ %}
//lovely_variable is a constant pointer to an int.
(int)* const lovely_variable
{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight c++ %}
//great_variable is a constant pointer to a constant int.
(int const)* const great_variable
{% endhighlight %}

###References

C++ references follow similar rules as pointers.  

{% highlight c++ %}
int var = 22;
int const & ref_to_const = var; // OK
{% endhighlight %}
You can’t change the value of `var` through `ref_to_const` because it is a read-only reference although `var` itself is not constant. You can change `var` directly. This is useful in function declarations to protect the variable passed from being overwritten inside the function body.

A declaration of a const reference is redundant since references can never be made to refer to another object:
{% highlight c++ %}
//the "const" is redundant
//error: 'const' qualifiers cannot be applied to 'int&'
int & const const_ref = var; 
{% endhighlight %}

###Methods (functions for classes and structs)

If you add `const` after the method declaration, this means that you can’t change any of the data members inside the method. 

From Wikipedia:
> while const methods can be called by const and non-const objects alike, non-const methods can only be invoked by non-const objects.

In C++, the `this` pointer is an implicit argument passed to all instance methods. Therefore, applying a `const` modifier on a method implies that the `this` pointer is also `const`.

{% highlight c++ %}
class CuteClass {
    bool cute = true;
public:
    int get() const { // Note the "const" tag
      return cute;
    }
    void set(bool status) { // Note the lack of "const"
      cute = status; 
    }
};
{% endhighlight %}
